I think i have a crush on this guy, but right now i feel it is better to not have a r/s so i am trying to reject the feeling. But i see him almost everyday because of school/same class. He is really nice and friendly to me but i don't know if he feels the same way. I feel that i cannot reject these feelings anymore because i will feel sad not talking to him. What should i do?
